Increasing the heap size is not a "fix" it is a "plaster", 100% temporary. It will crash again in somewhere else. To avoid these issues, write high performance code.

Use local variables wherever possible.
Make sure you select the correct object (EX: Selection between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder)
Use a good code system for your program(EX: Using static variables VS non static variables)
Other stuff which could work on your code.
Try to move with multy THREADING


OutOfMemoryError usually means that you’re doing something wrong, either holding onto objects too long or trying to process too much data at a time.
 Sometimes, it indicates a problem that’s out of your control, such as a third-party library that caches strings or an application server that doesn’t clean up after deploys.
 And sometimes, it has nothing to do with objects on the heap.
